## 💡 Overview

**Project Dashboards** is a central hub for experimenting with and building visual dashboards to **track projects**, **KPIs**, and **progress metrics** — whether for Agile, Waterfall, CAPM/PMP, or hybrid methodologies.

Whether you're managing one project or juggling twenty, this repo aims to help **turn raw data into actionable insight**, using modern front-end libraries and intelligent layouts.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 📈 Visualize real-time project progress across teams
- 🗂️ Monitor multiple projects in a portfolio view
- 🧭 Align with CAPM or PMBOK phase tracking
- ⏱️ Time-based milestone tracking
- 🧮 Burnup/burndown charts, Gantt timelines, velocity, risk indicators
