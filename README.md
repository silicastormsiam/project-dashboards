# SilicaStormSiam Project Dashboard
Welcome to the Dashboards of all SilicaStormSiam Projects & Repositories, tracked via the SSS-Project Dashboard: [https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/2/views/1](https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/2/views/1). This mecca dashboard showcases all major projects under development by Andrew John Holland—past, current, and projected—including RATS (Recruitment Application Tracking System), Homelab Hardware Development, and CPM (Chatbot Project Management). Organized by the five PMBOK process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing), it offers graphical and dynamic data for recruitment visibility[^1]. The `project-dashboards` repository develops dashboards for SilicaStormSiam, demonstrating project management expertise.
