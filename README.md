# SilicaStormSiam Project Dashboard
Welcome to the Dashboards of all SilicaStormSiam Projects & Repositories, tracked via the SSS-Project Dashboard: [https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/2/views/1](https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/2/views/1). This mecca dashboard showcases all major projects under development by Andrew John Holland—past, current, and projected—including RATS (Recruitment Application Tracking System), Homelab Hardware Development, and CPM (Chatbot Project Management). Organized by the five PMBOK process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing), it offers graphical and dynamic data for recruitment visibility[^1]. The `project-dashboards` repository develops dashboards for SilicaStormSiam, demonstrating project management expertise.

## 💡 Overview

**Project Dashboards** is a central hub for experimenting with and building visual dashboards to **track projects**, **KPIs**, and **progress metrics** — whether for Agile, Waterfall, CAPM/PMP, or hybrid methodologies.

Whether you're managing one project or juggling twenty, this repo aims to help **turn raw data into actionable insight**, using modern front-end libraries and intelligent layouts.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 📈 Visualize real-time project progress across teams
- 🗂️ Monitor multiple projects in a portfolio view
- 🧭 Align with CAPM or PMBOK phase tracking
- ⏱️ Time-based milestone tracking
- 🧮 Burnup/burndown charts, Gantt timelines, velocity, risk indicators

---

## 🧱 Planned Dashboard Types

| Dashboard Type      | Purpose                                       |

| 🔹 **Portfolio View**       | High-level multi-project overview                |
| 🔸 **Project Timeline**     | Milestones, task breakdowns (Gantt-style)       |
| 🔹 **Status Heatmaps**      | Visual status indicators (RAG — Red/Amber/Green)|
| 🔸 **Velocity / Burn Charts** | Sprint tracking for Agile/Hybrid workflows     |
| 🔹 **Risk Matrix**          | Probability vs impact visualization             |
